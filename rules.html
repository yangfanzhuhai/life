            	<h3>zero-player</h3>


                <p>
                    Alter the initial configuration and observe how it unfolds.
                    <br>
                    The game's evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
                </p>

                <h3>edgeless grid</h3>
                <p>
                    The universe of the game is set out as a grid of cells. The grid is often assumed
                    to be infinite.
                    <br>
                    In this implementation the grid is wrapped around as a torus
                    (or dough-nut) so that each cell has eight neighbouring cells.
                </p>

                <h3>life or death</h3>
                <p>
                    Each cell is in one of two possible states: <strong>alive</strong> or <strong>dead</strong>.
                    <br>
                    At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by isolation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>colourful life</h3>
                <p>
                    Cells also have a colour: either red or green. 
                    <br>
                    When a new cell is born it inherits the majority colour of its surrounding cells.
